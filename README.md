# jumping-bot
<p>This was done as a project in my 2nd semester OOP course in SUST CSE (2nd major). The purpose of this project was to build a very simple game while getting familiar with basic OOP concepts and JAVA Swing. As that was just the beginning of my journey of learning OOP and JAVA, looking at it now I found it way too much messy and very hard to understand. And most interesting thing was though many OOP concepts were implemented in a wrong way due to my inexperience at that time, it worked nontheless the way I intended it to be.</p>

<p>Now as I have recently taken a Design pattern course, I tried to implemented those newly learnt refactoring knowledge on this project. As part of that renamed class, method and variables, deleted unnecessary codes and tried to add new classes with single purpose.</p>

<p>The concept of this game is very simple. There is a bot which is made using rectangles and circles and a ball which is moving from left to right. The bot has to jump to avoid the ball. If the ball collides with the bot the game will over, otherwise player will gain 1 point each time he/she is able to dodge the ball</p>

<p>To run the game, compile all files and run the game from StartGame class. The png file serves the purpose of adding a icon in the Swing frame</p>
